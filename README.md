Welcome! My name is Rosa Huh, and I built this website to showcase things that make my world a beautiful place. The contents include amateur photographs and stories from places I visited around the world, and books that have enriched my life. I cannot call myself a world-class traveler, but I love packing my bag and getting on the next train or plane in a heartbeat. My quick packing skills were also developed from moving around every few years. My unique English accent traces back to these wonderful cities: Seoul, Toronto and San Francisco Bay Area.
